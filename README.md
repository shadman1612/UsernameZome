This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome and no built-in UI is provided for it.
  
### Including the zome in your DNA

1. Create a new folder in the `zomes` of the consuming DNA, with the name you want to give to this zome in your DNA.
2. Add a new `Cargo.toml` in that folder. In its content, paste the `Cargo.toml` content from any zome.
3. Change the `name` properties of the `Cargo.toml` file to the name you want to give to this zome in your DNA.
4. Add this zome as a dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
username = {git = "https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/username-zome", package = "username"}
```
5. Create a `src` folder besides the `Cargo.toml` with this content:
```rust
extern crate username;
```
6. Add the zome into your `*.dna.workdir/dna.json` file.
7. Compile the DNA with the usual `CARGO_TARGET=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## Developer setup

This respository is structured in the following way:

- `zome/`: example DNA with the `username` code.
- Top level `Cargo.toml` is a virtual package necessary for other DNAs to include this zome by pointing to this git repository.

Read the [Zome developer setup](/zome/README.md).

## Contributions
We would like to thank [@guillemcordoba](https://github.com/guillemcordoba) and [holochain-open-dev](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev) for providing a reusable module template to easily create zomes that can be reusable in other Holochain pojects.
